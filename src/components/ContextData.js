      "For much of his career, Loeb has been a powerhouse of a cosmologist, churning out hundreds of papers on black holes, dark matter, and the first stars. But he has been captivated by the search for aliens since an interstellar object named Oumuamua zoomed by our planet in 2017. Here's what his latest claims are",
    detail: "On Jan 8, 2014, a fireball from space blazed through Earth’s atmosphere and crashed into the sea, north of Manus Island off the northeastern coast of Papua New Guinea. Its location, velocity and brightness were recorded by US government sensors and quietly tucked away in a database of similar events.  That data sat for five years, a source of no contention until Avi Loeb, a theoretical astrophysicist at Harvard University, and Amir Siraj, then an undergraduate student at the university, stumbled across it in 2019. Based on its logged speed and direction, Siraj identified the fireball as an extreme outlier.  Last month, Loeb led an expedition to retrieve fragments of the fireball off the western Pacific seafloor. On June 21, he claimed that he had. And such discoveries, he says to the chagrin of many of his colleagues, may be the way scientists find evidence of extraterrestrial life.  “Not biological creatures, the way you see in science fiction movies,” Loeb said. “It’s most likely a technological gadget with artificial intelligence.”  Many astronomers, though, see the announcement as the latest example of Loeb making an outlandish declaration that is too strong and too hasty. His pronouncements (and a promotional video in Times Square about the search for extraterrestrial life) skew public perception of how science actually works, they say.  “People are sick of hearing about Avi Loeb’s wild claims,” said Steve Desch, an astrophysicist at Arizona State University. “It’s polluting good science — conflating the good science we do with this ridiculous sensationalism and sucking all the oxygen out of the room.”  Desch added that several of his colleagues were now refusing to engage with Loeb’s work in peer review, the process by which scholars evaluate one another’s research to ensure that only high-quality studies are published. “It’s a real breakdown of the peer review process and the scientific method,” he said. “And it’s so demoralizing and tiring.”  For much of his career, Loeb has been a powerhouse of a cosmologist, churning out hundreds of papers on black holes, dark matter, the first stars and the fate of our universe. But he has been captivated by the search for aliens since an interstellar object named Oumuamua zoomed by our planet in 2017. While scientists debated whether that visitor was an asteroid or a comet from another star system, Loeb made the case that it could be an artifact of intelligent life."

    description: 'China has restated its goal to be the global leader in artificial intelligence (AI). When it comes to snooping on the public, the country has the edge but faces many other hurdles.',
    detail: "Chinese tech giants are speeding to catch up with their US peers in the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots. The world’s second-largest economy is on course to spend $15 billion (€13.5 billion) on AI projects this year alone, a rise of nearly 50% in just two years.  Even before the arrival of large language models like the Microsoft-backed Chat GPT, some tech experts refused to bet that the West would dominate the AI race, despite the most advanced AI labs being located in the US and UK.  Kai-Fu Lee, the Taiwanese computer scientist, venture capitalist and tech executive predicted in 2018 that China would quickly surpass the US as an AI superpower, insisting the technology had already passed the innovation stage.  Lee argued that the world was now in the AI implementation stage, where China has the edge, due to years of state surveillance. Snooping on the Chinese population has allowed the accrual of huge amounts of data, which AI platforms harness to improve their learning.  But while more than half of the estimated 1 billion surveillance cameras on the planet have been deployed in China, Lee’s critics argue that the AI revolution is still in its infancy and the West still holds the key.  “The big innovations in AI haven’t happened yet — far from it […] and the US currently has the advantage in that area,” Pedro Domingos, professor emeritus at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, told DW.  Domingos spoke of large data having “diminishing returns,” in that China won’t get a lot more benefit from snooping on its 1.4 billion population than the US does, with its 332 million inhabitants.  “The diversity of the data also matters. I would prefer to have the data from, say, Europe than China as it is more diverse and therefore you can learn more from it.”"

    description: 'OneWeb India Communications plans to invest up to Rs 100 crore in the project, which would, according to the Gujarat government, create 500 direct and indirect jobs, including jobs requiring telecom, electronics and instrumentation engineers.',
    detail: "The Gujarat government through its Department of Science and Technology (DST) on Wednesday (July 19) signed a memorandum of understanding with OneWeb India Communications Pvt Ltd for setting up a ‘satellite network portal site’ — a first for India — at Mehsana in Gujarat.  Satellite broadband technology or satellite telephony is not a new concept and with satellite constellations in the low Earth orbit (LEO) gaining traction with StarLink, Kuiper and OneWeb among many others, the world is increasingly moving towards relying on LEO satellite communications.  LEO satellites operate at an altitude of 500 to 1,200 km, making it ripe for high-speed and low latency — a lower time lag between a user seeking data, and the server sending that data, compared to geostationary Earth orbit positioned satellites.  OneWeb has 648 satellites orbiting at 1,000-1,200 km making 13 orbits per day, covering the entire globe. The satellite network portal (SNP) site will be serving as a signal and data downlink and uplink terminal or base station on the ground, an intermediary for data transmission through satellite tracking antenna systems.  Rahul Vatts, director of OneWeb India Communications, told The Indian Express, “To cover the entire Earth, we need 40 such SNPs but for India we need at least 2 such SNPs because India is such a large geography and we decided to set up one in Gujarat and another we are planning in the southern part of India, likely to be in Tamil Nadu.”  As per the financial year 2021-2022 annual report of OneWeb, it had nine operational SNP sites serving the live coverage area and at the time, had agreements to build 38 SNPs in 27 different countries."

    description: 'India’s space agency was the brainchild of Dr Vikram Sarabhai and has now come to represent a success story. Here’s a brief look at how it began.',
    detail: "Chandrayaan-3, the mission that aims to achieve the feat of conducting a “soft” landing on the Moon’s southern pole, launched off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) in Andhra Pradesh on Friday (July 14) afternoon.  It will now take approximately 42 days to reach the Moon. Should it conduct a successful landing, India will become only the fourth country – after the United States, Russia, and China – to have done so.  While a successful launch is only the first step towards a long journey for the spacecraft, Isro’s role in carrying it through has seen great appreciation, and it has become a symbol of national pride for many. That has been the case for long, such as in 2014, when the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) was inserted into the Martian orbit. The low cost of the mission was also highlighted as an achievement. Since its inception in 1969, the country’s space agency Isro has carried out altogether 89 launch missions carrying satellites into space. How did the agency chart this course? We take a look.  Early beginnings of a space agency, from a church in Kerala  The history of space activities in India reflects how little by little, institutions centred around space exploration and research were set up and expanded. Indian scientist EV Chitnis recounted in the book From Fishing Hamlet to Red Planet: India’s Space Journey, a compilation of essays from those involved in this journey, that the first such organisation was the Physical Research Laboratory set up in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.  Along with Vikram Sarabhai, a few scientists worked here but lacked adequate funds. Chitnis recalls putting together two boxes and an asbestos sheet as his work table."

    description: "The tire industry has been keeping up pace with the rising EV demand, but there is one problem it's struggling to crack.",
    detail: "As EV sales have soared, the tire industry has innovated its products to fit the needs of the relatively heavy, efficient and silent cars. But there is one problem the industry is struggling to crack.  As a car’s only point of contact with the road, tires do more work than they get credit for. Tires need to grip the road firmly enough for cars to accelerate, turn and brake without skidding, but they also need to reduce rolling resistance enough to maintain fuel efficiency.  For tire manufacturers, creating the perfect tire — one that balances performance and durability — is an unending task. In recent years, their work has been further complicated by electric vehicles (EVs).  Due to their bigger batteries, EVs tend to be significantly heavier than their internal combustion engine counterparts. Volkswagon‘s e-Golf, for example, is about 400 kilograms heavier than the gas-powered Golf VII. That added weight rests on the car’s tires, so EVs need tires that are sturdier.  EVs also tend to have more torque than combustion engines, which their tires need to be able to transfer to the road within seconds.  Leading tire manufacturers are working on improving tire designs, and innovating new chemical formulas to meet the needs of EVs. Some brands have introduced products specifically for use on battery-run vehicles, whereas others say they have adapted all of their tires to perform better for both EVs and combustion engine vehicles.  “We have been optimizing our product range for a long time, especially in terms of service life, rolling resistance and rolling noise — factors that are of particular benefit to electric vehicles,” a spokesperson for tire maker Continental told DW in a statement."

    detail: "An extreme global heat wave has been blamed on climate change, yet online misinformation has evolved to counter the facts — despite platforms like TikTok banning climate denial.  Record global temperatures on July 3 kicked off the hottest week ever recorded as intense heat waves gripped the planet. Climate scientist Friederike Otto, of London’s Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment, called the heat “a death sentence for people and ecosystems.”  Yet, the next day, a political journalist in the United Kingdom, Isabel Oakeshott, tweeted that “climate change headbangers panicking about a few hot days last month can calm down … It’s 13 degrees and pouring.” She added that she was “about to light the woodburner.” Within a day, over 2.2 million people had seen the tweet.  Oakeshott, a presenter on the conservative TalkTV news channel and former editor of the Sunday Times, often comments on Twitter about “climate change nuts.” On July 5, she asked: “Where’s Greta when it’s woolly jumpers in July?”  Amid the worst heat waves ever recorded in the United States, China, Mexico, Siberia and beyond, and near-unanimous scientific consensus that humans have induced global heating — in large part by burning fossil fuels — how does such denial continue to flourish?  The largest global survey on climate change opinion published in 2021 found that nearly 65% of people across diverse age ranges in more than 50 countries consider climate change a “global emergency,” yet researchers have found a recent resurgence in skepticism and denial."

    description: "Overture could mean a major shakeup for the online maps industry.",
    detail: "Online maps are essential for many mobile apps and emerging technologies — take food delivery apps like Swiggy, for instance — but they are mostly controlled by two tech giants: Google and Apple. These companies charge app developers for using their maps as a service and do not share the underlying data that powers them. However, a new initiative by Meta, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, and TomTom aims to change that.  Formed late last year, the Overture Maps Foundation is a collaborative effort to create and maintain open and free base map data that anyone can use to build their own maps. The foundation has collected 59 million points of interest, such as restaurants, landmarks, streets and regional borders, and plans to update them regularly with the help of artificial intelligence and other techniques.  Marc Prioleau, executive director of the OMF, told CNBC in an interview that there are companies that “if they wanted to invest to build the map data, they could.” However, companies prefer if they “just get collaboration around the open base map” rather than spend that kind of money.  Since Google’s and Apple’s maps do not grant access to the data behind them, they do not suit many companies. These companies offer their maps as a service, often charging app makers for each map request via an API. Meanwhile, by using Overture’s more readily-available data, app developers can customise their maps with their own proprietary information, such as pickup locations for delivery services, and avoid paying fees to Google or Apple. The foundation is offering this underlying data alone, leaving it up to other companies to build apps on top.  Overture hopes to provide a more reliable and curated alternative to OpenStreetMap, a crowdsourced map project that Meta uses in its own maps. It also hopes its members can contribute enough real-time information to enable the regular release of accurate updates instead of a one-time data dump. To make this possible, Prioleau plans to use AI and other automated techniques."

    detail: "With the iPhone X, Apple offered an iPhone that was all-display at the front for the first time (minus the notch that is). Subsequent releases trimmed down on those bezels further but Apple could now be planning on doing away with those entirely.  According to a report by TheElec, Apple is working on a new iPhone design that would completely eliminate the front bezel and offer a truly edge-to-edge display. The company has asked its OLED screen suppliers, Samsung Display and LG Display, to develop a version of the display that has no bezels at all.  The report claims that Apple also wants the suppliers to improve the technologies for Thin Film Encapsulation (TFE) – which is the technology that enables stronger, lighter, and more flexible AMOLED – and under-panel camera (UPC).  Creating a flat bezel-less display is not easy, though, as it involves making the TFE thinner and overcoming the limitations of UPC. Thinning the TFE could compromise its ability to block moisture and oxygen.  Apple has a rather cautious approach to picking hardware for its iPhones. The company has reportedly rejected the curved edge display technology that Samsung and other vendors have used, as it causes optical distortion and increases the risk of breakage. Instead, Apple wants a flat display that covers the entire front of the iPhone."

Australia's Federal Court also ordered Meta, through its subsidiaries Facebook Israel and the now-discontinued app, Onavo, to pay A$400,000 in legal costs to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which brought the civil lawsuit. From early 2016 to late 2017, the company which was then called Facebook advertised Onavo as a way for people to keep their personal information safe but collected their location, time and frequency using other smartphone apps, and websites they visited for its own commercial purposes, the judge Wendy Abraham said in a written judgment on Wednesday. 'The failure to make sufficient disclosures … may have deprived tens of thousands of Australian consumers of the opportunity to make an informed choice about the collection and use of their data before downloading and/or using Onavo Protect', Abraham wrote. She added that the court could have fined Meta hundreds of billions of dollars since Australians downloaded the app 271,220 times and each breach of consumer law carried a A$1.1 million fine, but 'the contraventions can be characterised as a single course of conduct'. The fine was agreed by the regulator and Meta but 'carries with it a sufficient sting to ensure that the penalty amount is not such as to be regarded … as simply an acceptable cost of doing business', she wrote."

The iPhone maker has now started accepting applications for its Vision Pro developer kit, which will allow developers to create apps and experiences for the headset. Apple is now accepting applications from interested developers for a “loaner” Vision Pro developer kit, as reported by The Verge. 'We'll loan you a Vision Pro developer kit to prepare your app for the launch of the new App Store on Vision Pro,' Apple said. And along with the kit, developers will also can avail help setting up the device, guidance by Apple experts for UI design and development and two 'code-level support requests,' so that developers can troubleshoot their code.  Developers will also need to return their Vison Pro developer kits when Apple asks. As per Apple, the kits will let developers build, iterate, and test on Vision Pro. Apple has also listed a number of requirements that must be met in order to be eligible for a developer kit. First, you must be an Account Holder in the Apple Developer Program and second, provide information about your development team's skills and any existing apps. Apple also mentions that it will prioritize developers who are working on “creating an app that takes advantage of visionOS features and capabilities.” This means that any developer looking to create a native app from scratch will have an easier time being noticed by Apple. The Apple Vision Pro will be available to consumers next year, but the exact release date is not yet known. The headset will cost $3499 and will be available in the US only, with availability for more countries coming later in 2024."

    detail: "The cinematic genius Christopher Nolan is one of the best minds in showbiz when it comes to delivering riveting, epic and extraordinary movies; The Prestige, Memento, The Dark Knight trilogy, Interstellar, Inception, Dunkirk & Tenet are classic examples of that. Talking about his new offering Oppenheimer, it narrates the magnificent tragic story of the American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (who is known as the ‘father of the atomic bomb’). Honestly, Oppenheimer has all the elements, which you expect from a Nolan film. Right from a haunting BGM, impeccable camerawork, emotional drama and twists with the superb combination of cerebral stuff and gripping, however, it gives you the experience of a non-Nolan affair. While the noise around Nolan not using CGI for the bomb explosion has been the talk of the town, in reality, the highlight is the filmmaker’s superlative narrative of the lead character (Cillian Murphy) and his life-changing incidents, that too in multiple shades, right from black-and-white to colour to symbolise the time and era. The historical psychodrama has a mesmerising first half, which includes Oppenheimer’s encounter with Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) at Princeton, his marriage to alcoholic Kitty (Emily Blunt) and other key incidents. But the second half surpasses your expectations, where we see the testing of the Atomic bomb, the World War II situation, Hiroshima & Nagasaki’s bombing effects and Oppenheimer being accused of the threat and questioning his loyalty to the United States of America. While Christopher Nolan has been a master of making every nuance and detail a perfect frame, this outstanding screenplay and cinematic experience has gone to the next level due to the exemplary performances of the ensemble cast. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. have easily delivered their career-best performances and are expected to be top contenders in the categories of Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor in all major award ceremonies. Matt Damon is charming, sharp and charismatic as General Leslie Groves. Emily Blunt impresses with her emotional yet layered portrayal of Katherine Oppenheimer. Despite being a 3-hour long film, Oppenheimer is a visual spectacle, which should be seen on the 70 mm screen, especially in the IMAX format."

    detail: "Being a Hollywood actor comes with immense fame and fortune, but not everyone is equipped to handle the pressures that come with it. In some cases, the intense spotlight and constant scrutiny can take a toll on an individual’s mental well-being. Here are seven Hollywood actors who found it difficult to cope with their celebrity status and unfortunately went crazy.  1. Charlie Sheen: Known for his roles in movies like Platoon and the hit TV series Two and a Half Men, Charlie Sheen’s fame took a dark turn. He battled drug addiction and displayed erratic behavior, making headlines for his public meltdowns and controversial statements. Sheen’s struggles eventually led to his departure from the show that brought him immense success.  2. Amanda Bynes: Amanda Bynes rose to fame as a child star in Nickelodeon shows like All That and The Amanda Show. However, as she transitioned into adulthood, Bynes faced numerous personal and legal issues. She struggled with mental health problems, including bipolar disorder and substance abuse. Bynes’ public breakdowns and erratic behavior alarmed her fans and the industry alike.  3. Lindsay Lohan: Lindsay Lohan gained fame through movies like Mean Girls and Freaky Friday. However, her rapid rise to stardom took a toll on her mental health. Lohan battled substance abuse issues, resulting in legal troubles and a decline in her career. Her struggles with addiction and unstable behavior overshadowed her once-promising talent.  4. Britney Spears: One of the biggest pop stars of the late ’90s and early 2000s, Britney Spears faced immense pressure and scrutiny from the media. As her personal life spiraled out of control, she experienced a highly publicized breakdown in 2007. Spears’ struggles with mental health led to a conservatorship that limited her autonomy for over a decade. Her case shed light on the darker side of fame and sparked discussions about celebrity mental health.  5. Joaquin Phoenix: Joaquin Phoenix is an immensely talented actor known for his intense performances. However, after the death of his brother, River Phoenix, he fell into a period of deep grief and struggled with substance abuse. Phoenix’s unconventional behavior, including his “retirement” from acting and bizarre public appearances, raised concerns about his mental well-being. Fortunately, he later made a successful comeback."

    description: "Priyanka Chopra Jonas starrer Citadel will or will not come out with Season 2. Some reports say that they wont. But the speculation is still on.",
    detail: "Earlier there were news that Priyanka Chopra’s Citadel will be coming up with its Season 2.  But later according to reports published in Hello magazine it was written that that Citadel has not officially been greenlit for a season 2.  A report in Forbes, quotes the reason for the same. The report states that Citadel might have had a good viewership and it booked the top spot on Prime, but the reason was majorly a scarcity for Prime Originals which made Citadel trend on their list.  Makers are sure that the series would grab a lot of headlines due to Priyanka Chopra Jonas but it was all about her professional and personal life, rather than about the show which put a serious question on the future of the $300 million series. But the speculation is still on.  About Citadel: Priyanka Chopra and Richard Madden’s show Citadel revolves around an international secret organisation Citadel. Priyanka Chopra plays the role of Nadia Sinh with Richard Madden as Mason Kane who are spy agents. The story goes this way that some eight years ago Citadel fell and these agents had narrowly escaped with their lives and remained hidden until one day when they get back together for yet another mission.  Verdict for Citadel: Citadel started off well. Visually appealing and two very attractive leads of the show, that is the main plus point of Citadel. But everything said and done, Citadel though pleasing to the eye, but there is not much newness to it. I would call Citadel to be a an above average routine spy thriller. It may not be a best spy thriller with a woman lead. But for me what matters is Priyanka Chopra’s professional achievement and how she grows with each project that she takes up in Hollywood. The first three episodes were good. But towards the end the viewers lost interest because there was nothing gripping about the content."

    detail: "Artificial Intelligence has sent shockwaves through creative sectors. The capacity to generate plausible, complex written content has made scriptwriters question if their abilities will one day be obsolete.  AI has also begun to demonstrate astounding powers in creating images and video, forcing people to imagine what if it completely replaces the need for real filmmaking?  Now, there is a fear from the coming torrent of AI tools that will mean just about anyone could recreate a person’s likeness and have them appear to engage in performances or acts without their consent.  With this, artificial intelligence has surged to the forefront of Hollywood’s labour fights. Standing alongside more traditional disputes over pay models, benefits and job protections, AI technology is the wild card in the contract breakdowns that have led actors and writer’s unions to go on strike  Also Read: Is Hollywood shutting down? Why actors joined writers on strike  The technology has pushed negotiations into unknown territory, and the language used can sound utopian or dystopian depending on the side of the table. Here’s a look at what the unions and their employers each say they want.  AI, the hot-button issue  As the technology to create without creators emerges, star actors fear they will lose control of their lucrative likenesses. Unknown actors fear they’ll be replaced altogether. Writers fear they’ll have to share credit or lose credit to machines.  The proposed contracts that led to both strikes last only three years. Even at the seeming breakneck pace at which AI is moving, it’s very unlikely there would be any widespread displacement of writers or actors in that time. But unions and employers know that ground given on an issue in one contract can be hard to reclaim in the next."

    detail: "Spyhide is a stalkerware app that might be stealing your private and sensitive data like passwords, contacts, messages, call logs, and real-time location data among other things.  According to a report by TechCrunch, once installed on a device, the phone surveillance app automatically hides itself which makes it difficult to find and remove. When planted on a victim’s phone, it continuously uploads information from the device to a remote server in the background.  What did Spyhide steal?  While they often operate stealthily, stalkerware apps sometimes leak information stolen from the victim’s phone. In a blog post, a Switzerland-based hacker named Maia Arson Crimew said he was able to access Spyhide’s source code and got access to a web-based dashboard where the victim’s stolen phone information was displayed.  Crimew noted that Spyhide’s database had detailed records of somewhere around 60,000 affected Android devices, with some even dating back to July 2018. This included information about each file on the device like when a photo or video was taken, where it was taken and when it was uploaded.  The stolen data also includes 3.29 million text messages which have confidential information like two-factor authentication codes, password reset links and 1.2 million call logs with details like number of receiver, and length of call. In addition to this,  it also contained 3,12,000 call recordings, 9,25,000 contact details, records for 3,82,000 photos and around 6,000 audio clips that were silently recorded from the victim’s phone without their knowledge.  The report reveals that Spyhide was able to access devices across all continents. Brazil and Europe had thousands of victims, while the United States had approximately 3,100 victims. Although this may seem like a small number, they were the most monitored in terms of location data.  The database also stored information of more than 7,50,000 people who signed up to use Spyhide and wanted to install the stalkerware on someone’s phone. However, most people who signed up did not pay for the spyware or installed it on another device."

    description: "Microsoft said costs rose sharply as it built new data centers to support AI and that capital expenditures will continue to rise.",
    detail: "Artificial intelligence is expected to pay off big for tech giants including Microsoft and Alphabet someday. But expect deeper investments before gains trickle to the bottom line, the companies said on Tuesday.  Microsoft said costs rose sharply as it built new data centers to support AI and that capital expenditures will continue to rise as it buys chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp to power those data centers.  Microsoft is bearing AI costs in two ways, analysts said: to power its own products such as its forthcoming $30-a-month Copilot AI assistant, and to serve companies wanting to use its Azure cloud computing services to create AI products.  Microsoft executives said the service will start generating the bulk of its revenue in the second half of its fiscal 2024 ending June 30.  “They’re buying a bunch of H100s,” said Ben Bajarin, chief executive and principal analyst of Creative Strategies, referring to Nvidia’s flagship chips for AI.  “You’re probably going to see a similar thing with Amazon if not this quarter then the next quarter, because both of them are the clouds that the vast majority of the market is using for training (AI systems) right now.”  Alphabet, however, kept down costs, though not for long. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, who will become president and chief investment officer, said delays in data center construction are why second-quarter capex was lower than expected.  “As far as AI is concerned, while Google may have spent upwards of $200 billion on AI investments over the past decade, much of that isn’t necessarily appreciated by users and investors,” said Scott Kessler, global sector lead for technology media and telecommunications at Third Bridge.  One advantage Google has, analysts said, is that it has its own custom chip for handling AI work called the Tensor Processor Unit (TPU), which helps lower costs.  Microsoft may be “aggressively buying Nvidia chips, given Microsoft does not have its own silicon as an alternative,” said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell.  But Google conceded that it will buy chips from other companies as well as using its own, and Porat said that spending could put a drag on profit and growth."

    description: "The Android version of the app is available on Play Store in four countries.",
    detail: "After months of anticipation, the ChatGPT mobile application is finally available for Android users. The Android app comes nearly two months after the iOS version was launched.  The app is now available in the US, India, Bangladesh, and Brazil. OpenAI has opted for a staged rollout instead of making the app available all at once worldwide.  The Sam Altman-led company had last week announced that users could expect the Android version of its sensational chatbot in the last week of July. Interestingly, the Android App comes at a time when ChatGPT has been grappling with reports of a slump in traffic and slower response times.  OpenAI has plans to expand the availability of the Android app in the coming weeks. While earlier the app was only restricted to iOS users, with the latest development, millions of Android users will be able to take advantage of ChatGPT. The app is free and syncs user history across devices, bringing the latest improvements from OpenAI.  ChatGPT, launched in November 2022 by OpenAI, is a large language model-based chatbot that has impressed the world with its astounding ability to offer human-like responses. The widespread adoption of the chatbot made it the fastest internet application to acquire as many as 100 million users in the shortest time – four months since its launch. It is built on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. As of now, GPT-4 is only accessible to ChatGPT Plus members who have to pay Rs 1,999 as a monthly subscription in India."

    description: "In a recent interview, Elon Musk revealed the real reason why he ditched the blue bird logo of Twitter.",
    detail: "Ever since Elon Musk announced the new logo for Twitter speculations are rife about the reasons behind the Chief Twit’s actions. On Monday, Musk unveiled a new logo, X, for Twitter purging the iconic blue bird logo that has cast a lasting imprint on the collective psyche of billions of users.  The new logo is a white X against the backdrop of pitch black and has already started to reflect on the web and mobile versions of the popular microblogging website.  While Musk has kept the world guessing about the true meaning of the sudden overhaul, a new report seems to be hinting at his grander intentions. A report on CNBC now claims that the name X represents Musk’s ambitions to create an all-encompassing platform ‘everything app’.  The 52-year-old technocrat said that the name Twitter made sense when it was just 140 characters going back and forth like birds tweeting. However, according to him now users can post ‘almost anything’.  Musk’s comments come at a time when the move is being perceived as risky by analysts as it is reverting decades of branding that went into making the brand Twitter.  Elon Musk took over Twitter in October 2022 after a prolonged acquisition drama. Ever since the acquisition, the Tesla boss has made several sweeping changes such as staff reduction and introducing a subscription model where anyone could get the coveted verified badge. He had even momentarily changed the logo to that of a dog named Shiba Inu after taking over the platform.  His most recent change was deploying former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino as CEO of Twitter. She took over the reigns as the new CEO on June 5, and the rebranding is the biggest development after her induction.  On Monday, Yaccarino was among the executives who confirmed the rebranding. She took to her Twitter account to post “X is here! Let’s do this.” The CEO also posted a picture of the logo projected on the company’s offices in San Francisco."

However, it was only a matter of time before the outspoken filmmaker tweeted his take on the film's Bhagavad Gita controversy. (Also Read: Twitter thinks 'best ever CGI award goes to censor board' for Florence Pugh's black dress in Oppenheimer sex scene)  On Monday, Ram Gopal Varma tweeted, 'Irony is that an American nuclear scientist Oppenheimer read the Bhagwad Geeta which I doubt even 0.0000001 % of Indians read.'  His tweet is in reference to a contentious scene in the film, where the protagonist J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), known as ‘the father of the atomic bomb,’ is seen invoking a verse from the holy Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita immediately after a lovemaking scene with his girlfriend (played by Florence Pugh).  A user seemed to agree with Ram Gopal Varma's remark and wrote in the comment section of his tweet, “That too in Sanskrit, after learning Sanskrit.” Another user wrote, “We’ve heard enough Bhagavath Geetha interpretations from others than reading it once with our own interpretation unbiased and unprejudiced.”  A user also reacted to the objections raised by a section of the internet over how the scene plays out. They wrote, “Indians are more worried about showing the bhagvad gita in a bedroom.”  However, another user countered Ram Gopal Varma's remark and wrote, “Many Indians have read the Bible which I doubt 0.000000001% of Americans have ever dared to read...doesn't mean a thing RGV...” Another user wrote, “Bigger irony is that it includes you too sir!” Another user argued, “How can majority hindus understand it as it was in coded language, as it was the prerogative of a particular class to know the language for hundred of years.”"

The Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen-starrer has overtaken rival stable DC’s The Batman as the highest-grossing film of the year. As of Saturday, the Marvel film had earned over $800 million globally. The Batman, which released in March, has lifetime earnings are $769 million. Also read: Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness: Charlize Theron introduces her character Clea, fans welcome her to the MCU  According to a Forbes report, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness has now earned over $350 million in the US and an additional $465 million overseas, giving it a global gross of $815 million approximately. Trade experts predict the film to complete $950 million globally but are uncertain if it will reach the billion-dollar mark.  Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is part of the expansive Marvel Cinematic Universe and is the direct sequel to the 2018 film Doctor Strange. It also continues the storylines of Marvel and Sony’s Spider-Man: No Way Home and the Disney+ series WandaVision. Trade experts say this interconnectivity helped the film as people flocked to watch ‘the latest Marvel film’. The film is directed by Sam Raimi.  The Batman, on the other hand, is a stand-alone film with no connection to the DC Extended Universe, which includes tentpoles like Justice League, Aquaman, and Wonder Woman. The Batman failed to replicate the success of DC’s other hits like Aquaman and The Dark Knight (another Batman film), both of which made over $1 billion at the global box office.  Trade insiders have chalked it partly to the pandemic and partly to the film’s dark, noir tone. Robert Pattinson made his debut as Batman in the Matt Reeves film, which also starred Paul Dano, Zoe Kravitz, Colin Farrell, and Jeffrey Wright. A sequel has been announced.

    detail: "Director Joseph Kosinski's Top Gun Maverick, which features Tom Cruise, had a contrasting opening at the box office in India and the US. In the US, the film collected $51 million on its opening day. The film is already Tom’s best opening day ever beating Mission Impossible – Fallout's first-day collection. However, the film has not been able to make a mark in India and collected ₹4.75 crore on day one.  In Top Gun Maverick, Tom essays the role of Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell, who is grappling with the diminished standing of fighter pilots in a world that now wages war with drones controlled by people miles away on computers. Top Gun Maverick is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, Tom Cruise, Christopher McQuarrie and David Ellison.  As per a Deadline report, 'Top Gun Maverick at this Friday night hour is on its way to a $51 million opening day (which includes $19.3 million previews). It would not be shocking to wake up on Saturday morning and see that the sequel has edged out Iron Man 2 ($51.2M) to become Paramount’s top opening day ever. Already, the sequel is Tom Cruise’s best opening day ever in US/Canada besting Mission: Impossible – Fallout‘s first day of $22.8M by 124%.'  According to Boxofficeindia.com, 'Top Gun Maverick has also not been able to make much of an impact in India as collections have been poor over the first two days though it should do better than Anek. The film is doing outstanding business in North America and may well go close to $150 million over the four day holiday weekend. The collections of Top Gun Maverick in India are as follows: Wednesday - ₹25,00,000, Thursday - 2,00,00,000, Friday - 2,50,00,000. Total - 4,75,00,000 approx.'  The Hindustan Times review read, 'The sequel is not a superior film but it accomplishes a far tougher task--tie in the loose ends and culminate a story arc that began almost four decades ago. If Top Gun was a coming-of-age film, Maverick is about redemption and comebacks. It puts Maverick at a cross road in his life and career, where he knows he is running out of time but does not know how to let go. Tom Cruise has brought out the stubbornness and charm of the character wonderfully. And he has also allowed Maverick to grow older and somewhat wiser over the years. Despite the larger-than-life setting, he seems relatable, and the audience will grow to love him easily.'"

There have been several videos of fans cheering for Johnny over the weeks. On Saturday, Law & Crime Network shared one such video where Amber and Johnny were seen leaving the courthouse after Friday’s hearing. In the video, when Johnny exits the courthouse, a loud cheer goes up among the waiting fans. The actor is seen shaking the hands of all security personnel present and thanking them. He takes something out of his pocket and shows it to them with a smile.  The actor then turns towards the cameraman, recording it, and shakes his hand as well, before saying, “See you down the road!” Giving a salute to the camera, he then gets inside the car and waves to the fans before driving away.  Johnny has sued Amber for $50 million saying she defamed him when she claimed to be a victim of domestic violence in a Washington Post op-ed in 2018. Johnny’s lawyers have said that even though Amber didn’t name him, the implication damaged his career. He has further alleged that Amber was abusive towards him during their marriage.  Amber has countersued him for $100 million claiming that he has smeared her name by calling her a liar. She has maintained that she suffered physical and sexual abuse at Johnny’s hands.  Both trials have been running concurrently in Virginia for over a month. The jury is currently in deliberation and a verdict is expected to be delivered by the end of this month or in the first week of June."

Kathryn talked about how Amber had trained very hard for several months for an action sequence but when she arrived on the set, her role had shrunk and the scene was chopped out.  Kathryn also said Johnny's habitual 'tardiness, drinking and drug abuse' had hurt his career along with pursuing this and other lawsuits. 'He's causing his own demise,' she said."

    description: "After Sunny Deol said 'political blame game' was responsible for 'hatred between India and Pakistan', a section of social media users criticised his statement.",
    detail: "The cast and makers of Gadar 2 unveiled the trailer for Gadar 2, the sequel to Anil Sharma's 2001 blockbuster cross-border drama, on Wednesday. At the Gadar 2 trailer launch event, which was held on the occasion of Kargil Vijay Divas, Anil was joined by actors Sunny Deol and Ameesha Patel, as well as the rest of Gadar 2 cast. Sunny's statement on India-Pakistan relations at the trailer launch of his upcoming movie attracted attention, with many on Twitter, now termed X, criticising the actor.  The actor and BJP MP from Punjab’s Gurdaspur blamed the 'political game' for the hatred between India and Pakistan. Many on social media were unhappy with his 'diplomatic' statement, with some claiming he made the remark so people in Pakistan would watch Gadar 2. Others said the film should be boycotted because of Sunny's statement.  At Gadar 2 trailer launch, Sunny Deol said, 'Kuch le jane ya lene-dene ki baat nahi hoti hai. Baat hoti hai insaniyat ki. Jhagde nahi hone chahiye. Dono taraf utna hi pyar hai, yeh siyasi khel hota hai jo sab nafratein paida karta hai. Aur woh hi aap dekhenge iss film mein bhi. Janta nahi koi chahti ki ek dusre ke sath hum jhagda kare. Aakhir hai toh sab iss hi mitti se (The essence lies in humanity, not in taking or giving. A conflict between the two sides should not prevail. There is love on both sides. It is the political blame game that creates hatred between India and Pakistan, a theme reflected in this film. Both nations comprise of people who seek peace, as we are essentially one and the same).'  A person said on X, 'Come out of your cave, Sunny Deol. Go and visit Pakistani.' Another one said, 'It seems they want to run this film in Pakistan!! It means it will be super flop in India…' One person said, 'Gadar's USP was Pakistan bashing. The only plausible way for the Gadar sequel to succeed was to persist with that bashing, and make audience feel the nostalgia. But ironically the leading man is peddling the long dead 'aman ki asha (hope for peace)' sentiments at the promotions!'  A person also said, 'Is dialogue ke saath hi picture flop ho gai (With his statement, the film is already a flop). Boycott Gadar 2!' A person joked, 'This movie has such low buzz that even giving a boycott call will be considered as helping it. So let is die unsung unhonoured and unseen.'"

In a new interview with The Quint, Raghav Chadha opened up about life after engagement with Parineeti Chopra. The politician said that his colleagues and seniors tease him less now, since he is set to marry soon.  The two never publicly spoke about them dating, but reportedly, they knew each other for several years before making their relationship official in May. Since their engagement, pictures and videos of them from Rajasthan had surfaced online as they visited various locations, scouting for their wedding venue.  Recently Raghav was asked how his life had changed after engagement with Parineeti. 'Well, I think we should restrict this conversation to political alliances and not personal alliances. But yes, most certainly, my colleagues, co-workers in the party, and my seniors tease me a little less now... Earlier they used to ask me to get married, now they tease me a little less because they know I am getting married soon,' Raghav told The Quint.  Parineeti Chopra and Raghav Chadha got engaged in the presence of family and friends on May 13 at Kapurthala House in New Delhi. The couple was twinning in white ethnic outfits for the ceremony that was attended by everyone from actor Priyanka Chopra to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. After their engagement, Parineeti and Raghav had also stepped out to greet the paparazzi and posed for photos as they made their first public appearance as a newly-engaged couple.

    detail: "Given the buzz around Karan Johar's latest directorial venture, trade experts believe Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahaani will likely make an opening collection of ₹8-10 crore on Friday. The film stars Alia Bhatt, Ranveer Singh, Dharmendra, Shabana Azmi, and Jaya Bachchan in the lead roles. It is slated for a theatrical release on July 28  Producer and film business expert Girish Johar said that he expects a good opening for Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahaani. “It is the one big film after Pathaan. We have had Zara Hatke Zara Bachke and Satyaprem Ki Katha (that performed well at the box office) this year, but these were mid-budget films.”  He added that the film may open at anything between ₹8-10 crore on Friday, and the collections will hopefully rise over the weekend. 'If the audience really loves the film, and it manages a double-digit score on day one…if it maintains that, and rises to ₹12 crore or so on the second and third days, it can comfortably make ₹35-40 crore in the first weekend. Anything above that would be excellent, but anything below would mean that the film failed to match the audience's expectations. But that remains to be seen.'  “Now this one not only comes from Dharma - a premium production company of the country - but also boasts of top A-listers from the industry. We have veterans like Jaya ji, Dharmendra ji, and Shabana ji. We also have the cream from the current lot - Ranveer and Alia,” Girish said, adding that the film's director (Karan) also adds to the credibility."

Kareena took to Instagram on Wednesday and shared a sweet picture that featured Jeh. Both of them were seen taking an afternoon nap in a garden.  The picture showed Kareena taking a nap on the field, with a blue bedsheet spread on the ground. Jeh was seen leaning on her back and resting his head near her shoulder.

    detail: "Filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri has reacted to the Adipurush controversy. In an interview with The Times of India, Vivek said what he thought went wrong with the Om Raut film that released in theatres on June 16. Adipurush starred Prabhas, Kriti Sanon and Saif Ali Khan in pivotal roles.  Adipurush, which is an adaptation of the epic Ramayana, has drawn heavy criticism post-release. From critics to audiences, many voiced misgivings over certain dialogues in the film. Among the dialogues over which the makers have drawn flak are 'marega bete', 'bua ka bagicha hain kya' and 'jalegi tere baap ki'. In the face of online outrage and negative reviews, the makers of Om Raut's Adipurush revised the dialogues as well. All India Cine Workers Association also wrote a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Mumbai Police, demanding the registration of a case against the producer, director, and writer of the film.  In a new interview with The Times of India, Vivek said, 'When you make something you don't believe in, just because aajkal ye chal raha hai (today this topic is trending), you are definitely going to go wrong. When you pick up stories of faith, either you yourself should have 100% conviction or you should be well versed in the subject like a historian, but unfortunately no one does that in India... Anybody who will try to take stars for either Mahabharata or Ramayana, will never be able to complete it… There's a reason why Mahabharat, Bhagavad Gita and Ramayana have been entrenched in everyone's psyche for years. If something has lasted for 5000 years, there has to be a reason for it.'"

Sharing it on her IG stories, Uorfi wrote with the video, 'While travelling from Mumbai to Goa on one of the flights yesterday I had to go through harassment, the men in this video were saying nasty things, Eve teasing and calling names. When I confronted them one of them said that their friends were drunk. Being drunk is no excuse to misbehave with women. Public figure YES, Public property NO.'  Uorfi gained limelight after appearing on Bigg Boss and Splitsvilla. She is known for her quirky, risque DIY fashion choices and appearances.  Recently, in an interview to Humans of Bombay, Uorfi spoke about how her pictures once landed on a porn site when she was still a teenager. 'When I was 15, someone uploaded my picture on a porn site. It was a normal picture. I uploaded it wearing a tube top as my Facebook profile photo. Someone downloaded them and uploaded it on a porn site without morphing, without anything. Slowly, everyone got to know about it. Everyone started blaming me a lot. I was told I am a porn star. I was like ‘Where is the video?’ But they said, ‘No, no she is a porn star’,' she said."

The next installment, Student of the Year 3 (SOTY 3), will also mark the OTT debut of budding actor Shanaya Kapoor, Sanjay Kapoor and Maheep Kapoor’s daughter.  It was recently announced that Shanaya Kapoor's film debut will not be Karan's Bedhadak; she'll be launched with Mohanlal's pan-India film Vrushabha instead. Shanaya has already worked in the capacity of an assistant director on cousin-actor Janhvi Kapoor-starrer Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl. However, her transition into acting has been discussed over the past few years.  Karan Johar is turning the Student of the Year movie franchise into a web series in partnership with Disney+ Hotstar, as per a Pinkvilla report. The project is currently in the writing stage and is scheduled to go on floors in the last quarter of this year, added the report. The Disney+ Hotstar show is expected to introduce some more fresh faces alongside Shanaya, and the casting process for that is reportedly underway.  Further details about the show's plot are awaited, but as per the sources quoted in the report, the work on this series is going on in full swing at Dharma’s digital content arm, Dharmatic Entertainment. The director for the series is expected to be finalised within a month.  News of Shanaya's Bollywood launch has been around for the past two years. The star kid was initially set to make her acting debut with Karan Johar's Bedhadak, alongside Lakshya Lalwani and Gurfateh Pirzada.  However, the Shashank Khaitan directorial was reportedly shelved due to script issues. Now, veteran Malayalam actor Mohanlal’s upcoming film Vrushabha will finally mark Shanaya's first movie as an actor."

    detail: "Remember Rachel Shelley from Lagaan? The British actor played Elizabeth Rusell in Ashutosh Gowariker's 2001 historical epic starring Aamir Khan. When I saw her first pop up in Sudip Sharma's new Netflix show Kohrra, I couldn't help but recall her lip-syncing to “No drop of rain, no glowing flame, Has ever been so pure, If being in love can feel like this, Then I'm in love for sure.” But the song faded as quickly as the joy of returning to India on her face. Her son is missing.  Kohrra, co-created and co-written by Sudip, Gunjit Chopra and Diggi Sisodia, and directed by Randeep Jha, is set in Punjab. Balbir Singh (Suvinder Vicky) and Garundi (Barun Sobti) are cops investigating the murder of Paul, the son of a local influential man, and the missing case of his best friend Liam, an NRI from the UK, son of Clara (Rachel Shelley).  Rachel Shelley, like us, realises very quickly that she is not in Lagaan. She's not a powerful white man's sister in British India. She's a hapless outsider in a state that runs on the nexus between powerful leaders and drug cartels.  Kohrra has shades of Abhishek Chaubey's Udta Punjab (2016), which was co-written by Sudip Sharma. The trailer may also give the impression that Kohrra is a fast-paced, thrilling ride like Sudip's Prime Video show Pataal Lok. But I suggest those expecting the same to manage their expectations: Kohrra is the slowest of slow burns. It takes more than an episode to warm up to its pace and its world. The pace still doesn't pick up, but the investment in certain characters does. The final reveal isn't worth pulling along, unless one's found a character to latch on to."

Instead of being charge sheeted by his co-contestants during the elimination rounds or getting voted out by the viewers, Chetan was locked out of jail by the producers for misbehaving with jailor Karan Kundrra.  A promo of the show shared on the Instagram account of Alt Balaji on Saturday had shown Chetan breaking the rules of the prison. The post, that announced Chetan's eviction, was shared with the caption, 'Misbehaviour ko sirf dismissal milta hai yahan! @chetan_hansraj huye locked out (Misbehaviour is dismissed here, Chetan Hansraj is locked out, what do you think about it?)'  The video started with Anjali Arora saying the contestants get ready to take unnecessary actions after getting charge sheeted. Chetan then gets up and starts tampering with the rules written on a blackboard, amid warnings from his fellow contestants who say, 'Don't remove!' Kaaranvir Bohra can be heard saying, 'Chetan don't do this.'  However, Chetan erases a part of the word jailor on the background to make it read tailor. Then he reads the new sentence, 'Rules badalna tailor ki marji hai (tailor can change rules on his wishes).' As Kaaranvir Bohra asks Chetan why is he acting like this soon after telling the jailor that he is his fan, Chetan says, 'I don't give a f*** about their rules. I won't follow any rules, what can they do?'"

In an interview with Quint, 'I thought of her two years ago. As the format was forming, I felt digital needs a shakeup, a clutter-breaker. And she's pretty much a clutter-breaker. And not only controversial, she's a clutter breaker. Thought process wise also. Secondly, I wanted to do a reality show with a female host. I feel that was missing in India. We don't take this female host seriously because we are very fitting in girls. Girls will come in the typical saree look and they will stand there and giggle...Women are doing that in a lot of other spheres but she's the right person to bring in for this thought that female host, female running the show and taking on a whole captive reality format forward.'  On working with Kangana, she said, 'I've done three films with her and I've had a great experience. I've known her to be pretty non-biased like if you see her now also with Munawar (Faruqui) and her, they get along famously on the show. That shows the non-bias is there. She won't go on a show and say, 'Ok I don't get along with this guy or his political beliefs so I'm not gonna like him on the show'. She comes in, she's pretty non-biased, she likes the person how he's playing his game and I love that about her. I knew that she's interesting. She has (her) points of views and they're pretty strong and that sometimes rattles a lot of people, sometimes I don't even agree with them but mostly there's mutual respect and that's the greatest reason we can work together.'"

    description: "The report recommended performing 4x2 minutes of wall sits, with two-minutes’ rest in between, three times a week, alongside other forms of exercise.",
    detail: "Unlike what has long been considered, a new study claims that isometric exercises that require the body to be held in one position can be twice as effective as moderate-intensity aerobic activity. While the results showed that significant reductions in resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred after all exercise types, it was specifically isometric exercises like planks and wall sits or wall squats that were most effective, reported the study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.  It examined 270 randomised controlled clinical trials, involving 15,827 participants.  According to Jamie O’Driscoll, a reader in cardiovascular physiology at Canterbury Christ Church University and senior author of the report, the reduction in blood pressure could be attributed to the static contraction of the muscles that squeeze the vessels that supply blood to the working muscles. “That reduces the flow of blood to the muscle during exercise and therefore oxygen supply to the muscle. When the muscles relax afterward, it causes a large flow of blood through the vessels, triggering greater improvements in blood flow regulation,” said Driscoll in a statement.  The report recommended performing 4×2 minutes of wall sits, with two-minutes’ rest in between, three times a week, alongside other forms of exercise.  Acknowledging that aerobic exercise training, dynamic resistance training, combined training, high-intensity interval training, and isometric exercise training are all significantly effective in reducing resting systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. “Comparatively, isometric exercise training remains the most effective mode. The findings of this analysis should inform future guideline recommendations,” it noted."

    detail: "Bollywood celebrities are at the peak of their fitness routine and have always managed to create awe around their transformation with the help of celebrity trainers. As such, when Lloyd Stevens, fitness trainer and transformation specialist, shared a throwback picture of actor Ranveer Singh from his 2016-Befikre days, we couldn’t help but go down the memory lane with Stevens, who opened up about how Singh managed to surprise everyone with his chiselled physique.  “Was tidying up my camera roll and came across this picture of Ranveer Singh looking jacked. This was the prep for Befikre and we were in Paris/France at that time,” he shared.  What was the secret? “Kept it simple, pure consistency and hard work … that’s it,” added Stevens.  According to Stevens, people tend to underestimate the basic principles of consistent hard work. “Everyone these days is looking for a quick fix. In fact, I can confidently tell you, the faster the results, the more likely the method you used will be unsustainable in the long-term,” said Stevens.  Rishabh Telang, fitness expert, Cult.fit shared a few pointers to include physical activity that can help you stay on track with your fitness goals.  Physical activity doesn’t have to feel like a chore. Try incorporating a variety of activities such as dance, yoga, and team sports to keep your workouts engaging. Aim for consistency and genuinely go for workouts you enjoy. However, do include strength training in your everyday routine to ensure there is no loss in muscle mass, said Telang."

    description: "Bala Krishna Reddy, co-founder, Fittr said that this simple yet potent exercise offers a holistic approach to fitness",
    detail: "Virat Kohli continues to impress with his unwavering commitment to fitness. Of late, he has been sharing several glimpses of his workout routines, serving as a major source of inspiration for many. As such, Kohli recently introduced his fans and followers to his preferred exercise for enhancing mobility and strength.  “My go-to exercise for mobility plus strength? Goblet squats,” he captioned the post on Instagram.  Notably, strength and mobility are defined by fundamental body movements such as squats, lunges, hinges, push, pull, rotate, and walking. “When performing functional exercises, we include multi-joint exercises such as squats, deadlifts, lunges, shoulder presses, rowing, push-ups, loaded carries, or some rotational exercises like woodchop. These activities reflect everyday behaviour. When we climb stairs, we lunge, when we pull open a door, we row, when we lift a sack of rice off the ground, we deadlift, when we carry shopping bags in our hands and walk to our car, we do loaded carries,” said Varun Rattan, co-founder, The Body Science Academy.  For the unversed, the simple but effective movement of goblet squats gets its name from the act of holding a goblet or a drinking glass with a foot and a stem which resembles the practice of holding a kettlebell or a dumbbell in front of the chest.  Calling goblet squats a transformative addition to leg days which propels one’s weight loss journey to new heights, Bala Krishna Reddy, co-founder, Fittr said that the simple yet potent exercise offers a holistic approach to fitness. “The goblet squat engages multiple muscle groups simultaneously, including the glutes, quads, and core, fostering better muscle development and strength,” said Reddy.  Also Read | Asha Negi does the kettlebell workout; know all about it  With proper form and technique, this exercise can enhance your overall balance and stability, minimising the risk of injuries. “The added resistance from the weight challenges your body to burn more calories, expediting fat loss and toning your lower body,” mentioned Reddy."

    detail: "Kartik Aaryan has been in the limelight for all the right reasons. The now bankable actor who has delivered back-to-back hits at the box office is all set to get stronger with fitness trainer Tridev Pandey for his next sports-based film Chandu Champion heralded by filmmaker Kabir Khan. As such, he was seen teaming up with Pandey at the gym.  Take a look at a glimpse shared by Pandey on Instagram.  “Time to get stronger for the strongest role. Let’s do this @kartikaaryan!” wrote Pandey, who is known for training actors like Sanya Malhotra, and Shweta Tripathi Sharma among others.  Reports suggest the role would see him in the role of an unknown sports hero.  Taking a cue from Kartik’s role in the film that seems to hint at a bulked-up physique, let’s understand how one can approach bodybuilding.  How to approach bodybuilding?  Gauthaman Ramesh, fitness expert, Cult.fit said that bodybuilding is prioritising your workout program to focus on building muscle.  “More often than not, a lot of fitness enthusiasts misunderstand the concept of bodybuilding and relate it to something hardcore that they often think is beyond their scope of achievement. This need not necessarily mean doing hours and hours of exercise at the gym,” said Gauthaman.  Gauthaman also shared how one can start their training routine:  *Work out for 4-5 days a week with an equal split of upper body and lower body exercises with approximately 18-25 sets per day. This combines all the exercises done for the day.  *Ensure you track your workouts by keeping a note of the weights you used and try to slowly increase the weights you lift on a week-on-week basis. Notably, progressive weight training or progressive overload gives stimulus to the muscles to grow stronger. This, experts urge, is important to make progress in one’s fitness regimen."

It’s the first Monday of the new month and this is your reminder to stay consistent with your Yoga practice,” she wrote in the caption.  According to Neeraj Pandey, Senior Yoga Coach, Fitelo, it is important to understand that the word ‘Yoga‘ is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Yuj’, which means to unite. “This translates to the essence of Yoga, which is focused on unifying individual and universal consciousness to create the perfect balance and harmony between mind (mental) and body (physical).”  Adding, he said, “Yoga is known to help improve cardiovascular fitness, enhance posture, and even recover from physical injuries in some cases. On the other hand, poses, breathing, and meditation, which are at the core of Yoga, promote mental health, enhance concentration, increase patience with your body and mind, and reduce stress and anxiety.”"

    detail: "Every year, International Day of Yoga is celebrated on June 21 to promote the age-old practice of yoga and its numerous benefits for your mental and physical health. Incorporating yoga into your routine, even when you have a busy schedule, is essential for several reasons.  Yoga is known to help in reducing stress, improving flexibility, enhancing concentration and fostering overall well-being. Despite a hectic lifestyle, taking out a few minutes for yoga can provide immense physical and mental rejuvenation.  But how can you do that? We reached out to yoga experts who shared some effective tips if you wish to begin practising yoga but don’t have a lot of time to spare.  Dr Rajeev Rajesh, Chief Yoga Officer, Jindal Naturecure Institute, Bangalore said when life becomes overwhelming and packed with responsibilities, yoga often becomes one of the first activities we abandon. “Professionals and parents don’t have much time available in their daily schedule to take out time for yoga or any kind of physical activity,” he said.  However, he believes that it can still be possible to include yoga in your daily schedule with a few adjustments and mindful planning. “Establishing a daily yoga practice brings numerous benefits and serves as an excellent tool for finding balance amidst a hectic lifestyle,” Dr Rajesh added.  Whether you’re a yoga novice or struggling to commit to a daily routine at home, here are a few valuable tips shared by the expert to simplify, enhance, and maintain daily practice with ease.  Morning or evening routine: Consider incorporating yoga into your morning or evening routine. Wake up a few minutes earlier or dedicate a few minutes in the evening to perform a short yoga session. This can help energize you in the morning or relax your mind and body before you sleep.  Lunchtime stretches: If possible, take a break during your lunch hour and use part of that time for a quick yoga practice. Find a quiet space, either indoors or outdoors, and perform a few simple stretches and poses to refresh your body and mind."

    description: "When women share their shy girl workouts online, it not only helps give other women ideas about the kind of workouts they can do, but it also normalizes experiences that are common to many women.",
    detail: "Social media is full of fitness trends. While some of these are outlandish or verging on dangerous, others are actually helpful.  Take the “shy girl workout” trend. While this has been floating around the internet since late 2022, it continues to be popular online.  The premise of shy girl workouts is simple. They are designed to use minimal space in the gym and only a couple of pieces of equipment – such as a pair of dumbbells.  They’re targeted at women who may be beginners or who have anxiety about going to the gym but still want to get a good resistance workout without having to move around the gym floor or use complicated weight machines.  While the initial benefit of these workouts is that they can help you get over your fear of going to the gym, they may also have the more long-term benefit of empowering users and helping them feel more confident about being in the gym.  There’s a great deal of research showing that women face societal pressures to attain the perfect fit and toned physique. This pressure is particularly acute in exercise environments (such as the gym) where people’s bodies are the focus. Women who feel they don’t have the ideal body may therefore feel uncomfortable going to the gym.  Many women often feel like they’re being “looked at” when they’re in the gym. This feeling is known as “hypervisibility”, and tends to happen when people think they’re different from others in a particular social setting.  In the case of the gym, hypervisibility occurs due to the male-dominated nature of the space, making women feel like they stand out. This feeling of hypervisibility can worsen women’s existing body insecurities and may encourage some women to avoid the gym altogether."

    detail: "Practising yoga or any form of exercise in the morning, particularly in the early hours, can be highly beneficial as it sets the tone for your day. Starting your day with exercise can provide you with increased energy and help you perform a good workout. While many people find that practising yoga in the morning helps them start their day with a sense of calmness and energy, it is not the only time that yoga can be beneficial. As such, yoga practitioner Swati opened up about the ideal time to practise yoga.  “The ideal time to practice yoga is during the Sandhya Kalas. Twenty minutes before and after sunrise, noon and sunset, this is known as Sandhya Kala period or the transition period,” said Swati.  “It is believed in the Yogic culture that during this period, the flow of energy is in an upward state. So naturally, practising yoga during Sandhya Kalas would help you go beyond your limitations. But this may not hold true for everybody given their schedules. In that case, practise it whenever you want, just make sure there is a gap of 2-3 hours between your meal and yoga practice,” she added.  Even yogic texts and traditions recommend practising yoga in the early morning, known as “Brahma Muhurta”. This time, approximately one and a half hours before sunrise, is considered spiritually charged and conducive to meditation and deep introspection, mentioned Dr Swapnil Kamble, medical officer, Godrej Memorial Hospital, Mumbai. As such, taking a cue, we decided to seek expert opinions on when is the right time to practise yoga."

    detail: "Although running is widely regarded as one of the most effective methods to maintain fitness, it can give rise to uncertainties among newcomers or individuals with injuries. So, we decided to decode whether running increases the risk of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA), a condition where the protective cartilage around the joints wears down. Neurologist Dr Sudhir Kumar, Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad created an interesting thread on the same on Twitter.  “This is a common question in the minds of new #runners as well as experienced runners. There are no randomised controlled trials, however, there are >25 excellent research papers on the topic,” said Dr Kumar, suggesting that running, in general, is protective against knee and hip joint inflammation and damage. “The risk of OA is lower among runners as compared to nonrunners,” he added.  According to him, running does not lead to OA of knees and hips if the weekly #mileage is between 21-42 km. In contrast, the risk of hip OA increases among elite runners with weekly mileage > 92 km.  Citing the Journal of Orthopedics and Sports Physical Therapy 2017, Dr Kumar said that recreational running protects knee and hip joints with lower mileage, and lower number of years of running as compared to higher mileage, longer duration, and competitive running.  The study mentioned that running can cause OA in competitive runners with recreational runners having lower rates of hip and knee osteoarthritis (3.5 per cent) as compared to competitive runners (13.3 per cent) and nonrunners (10.2 per cent)"

In 2021, she made it to the India Book of Records for lifting 45 kgs. As such, a natural question to ask is whether it is safe for children to do deadlifts or lift any kind of weight. Here’s what experts told us.  “Deadlifting for kids is a safe and effective way to improve their health, fitness, and overall well-being,” said Varun Rattan, co-founder, The Body Science Academy, Noida.  Lifting doesn’t stunt growth  One of the biggest myths surrounding deadlifting for children is that it stunts their growth. However, this is not true. Dr Ayyappan V Nair, Consultant – Shoulder Surgery, Sports Medicine and Arthroscopy, Manipal Hospital Whitefield, Sarjapur, and Jayanagar, Bangalore said it doesn’t affect growth. “At the same time, it’ll help in sport growth because whenever you’re loading, better growth is noted. The only catch is if you suffer from an injury, like a growth plate injury from a deadlift, then, you can have growth affection. Otherwise, it helps in the growth of the child,” said Dr Nair.  According to Rattan, deadlifts can help children develop good posture, which can make them appear taller. “It can also help them build muscle, which can make them stronger and healthier,” said Rattan.  “Lifting weights is also good for children’s mental health, builds confidence, reduces stress levels and improves their self-esteem. It can also help them develop a positive body image and a healthy relationship with their bodies,” said Rattan."

    detail: "The wrists are extremely vital. From writing to holding objects, without your wrists your hands would practically be non-functional. However, wrist pain is relatively common, which can be caused due to a variety of issues such as acute injury, arthritis, gout and carpal tunnel syndrome. This makes it important to protect your wrists from getting hurt.  Addressing this, Anshuka Parwani, Yoga instructor and Holistic Wellness Expert took to Instagram to share a few exercises to help combat wrist pain. “We often tend to experience wrist pain while working out. This can happen due to various factors like ligament strain, sudden pressure on the muscles while exercising, lack of mobility etc. Strong wrists are very important as they place a major role in stabilising the arms during various fitness drills and workouts,” she said.  Demonstrating a range of exercises which can help combat wrist pain while working out, Parwani added, “Here are some simple movements and exercises that will help to strengthen the wrist muscles, build grip strength, increase flexibility and reduce the risk of injuries.” We asked an expert on how these exercises help. Take a look.  Palms open and close  Jiggyasa Gupta, a nutrition and fitness coach, FITTR said, “This is one of the restorative, strengthening hand therapy exercise and is also used as a warmup in intense yoga poses,” adding that the steps are quite simple, “Inhale and spread the fingers. Then exhale, bringing the fingers together and repeat for few breaths”.  Wrist rotation  Explaining the benefits of this, Gupta said that wrist rotations are an excellent movement that takes the wrist joint through a wide range of motions. “Wrist rotations can aid in increasing mobility, preventing injuries, and improving blood flow to the active muscles.”  As for the process, “It can be performed by grasping a hand weight or similar object in each hand or just simply close the fist. Keeping your forearms by your sides, rotate your hands until your palms are facing up or toward the front of your body. Hold for 10 to 15 seconds and repeat 5 to 10 times”."

    description: "Adapting the exercises to suit an individual's present fitness level helps prevent unnecessary strain or potential injuries, said Aminder Singh, a fitness expert",
    detail: "Talking about the advantages of performing planks, Singh said that this exercise involves applying force without any movement, making it a versatile and beneficial exercise for individuals with varying fitness levels. “Another crucial advantage of planks is that there are numerous variations of them to suit individual abilities. Whether you are older, more fragile, or muscular, the plank can be customised to fulfill your specific needs and goals,” he added.  As for pushups, Singh noted that they mimic the movement pattern of a flat bench press, making them an ideal alternative to conventional weightlifting exercises. “The resistance applied during pushups is about 63 percent of your body weight. For instance, if you weigh 100 kilograms, you would essentially be pushing around 63 kilograms. The primary advantage of pushups lies in their adaptability, as you can modify the load according to your specific requirements and abilities, ranging from wall pushups for beginners to full-body weight pushups,” he continued.  But which is better for beginners?  Singh said that when comparing plank with pushups, the former is easier for beginners. “This is because to perform pushups, you need to first get into a plank position. Moreover, pushups can be difficult as they involve balancing your body weight on your arms and moving up and down. This requires exceptional arm and shoulder strength which can only be acquired by continuous exercise. So, beginners should go for planks first and gradually progress towards pushups or half-pushups,” he added."

    detail: "Do you ever feel that your back is stiff and sore despite sleeping well at night? Well, you are not alone. However, there is nothing to worry about, as the solution lies in making an extremely simple lifestyle change. According to experts, the reason lies in how you get off bed every morning — as it is the time you are most prone to back pain and hurting your lower back.  When you sleep, the disc pressure in your spine increases, meaning you’re more likely to suffer a disc injury first thing in the morning than at any other time. So, if you get out of bed the wrong way, this disc pressure can lead to back pain and other problems.  Explaining the same, Dr Arvind Bhateja, lead neurosurgeon, Sparsh Hospitals, said: “Watch out when you get out of bed in the morning. The reason I am saying this is because, as a spine surgeon, many patients come to me after they got out of bed the wrong way or too suddenly when they wake up in the morning. I am going to show you the right way to take care of your back so that you don’t injure it when you are waking up first thing in the morning.”  “Just remember that when you wake up in the morning your body is cold and your muscles are stiff, making it the time your back is most susceptible and likely to get injured,” he continue  Demonstrating the right way to get out of bed, he said, “It’s always better to have prevention over cure. So when you wake up in the morning, remember to first stretch yourself out while you are still lying in bed. And if you’re lying on your back, first turn to your side, and then gently get your feet off the edge of the bed so that you use your feet as a counter weight to get your body up to sit straight on the bed using your hand for support.”  Dr Bhateja added that this is best way to ensure that you do not hurt your back when you get out of bed in the morning."

    description: "Stiff neck and shoulders can significantly impact our daily lives, causing discomfort and limiting our range of motion. However, through targeted exercises and yoga asanas, we can find relief, restore flexibility, and improve overall well-being.",
    detail: "1. Back and forward neck stretches. One of the most effective exercises for relieving neck stiffness is the back and forward neck stretch. This simple yet powerful movement involves gently tilting your head backward and forward while seated or standing. By stretching the muscles at the back and front of your neck, you can release tension, improve blood circulation, and enhance flexibility. Regular practice can lead to reduced stiffness and increased range of motion in the neck.  2. Ear to shoulder neck stretches. Ear to shoulder neck stretches provide a wonderful release for tight neck muscles. To perform this exercise, gently drop your ear toward your shoulder on each side, allowing the weight of your head to create a stretch. This movement targets the muscles on the side of the neck and upper shoulders, promoting relaxation and relieving tension. Regular practice of ear to shoulder neck stretches can improve posture and alleviate stiffness caused by hunching forward.  3. Cow face arms. Cow face arms, or Gomukhasana Arms, is a yoga pose that specifically targets the shoulders, upper back, and chest. By bringing your arms into a specific position resembling a cow’s face, you stretch and open the muscles and connective tissues in the shoulders. This asana helps relieve tension and tightness, enhancing flexibility and range of motion in the shoulders. Regular practice can also improve posture and counteract the effects of rounded shoulders.  4. Yoga belt rotation. Yoga belt rotation is an excellent exercise for releasing tension in the shoulders and promoting a greater range of motion. Start by holding a yoga belt or strap with both hands, shoulder-width apart. Extend your arms forward and then rotate them in a circular motion, gradually increasing the size of the circles. This movement helps stretch the muscles in the shoulders, upper back, and chest while improving joint mobility. Regular practice can alleviate stiffness and increase shoulder flexibility.  5. Low lunge thoracic. Low lunge thoracic opening is a yoga asana that targets both the neck and shoulders while also stretching the chest and upper back. Begin in a low lunge position with one foot forward and the other knee on the ground. Place your hands on your front knee and gently twist your upper body toward the front leg, looking over the shoulder. This asana helps release tension in the neck and shoulders, improves spinal mobility, and stretches the chest muscles. Regular practice can alleviate stiffness and improve overall posture."

    description: "Green tea mixed with lemon can provide a good amount of antioxidants. Combining a few food items together could provide high nutrition and maximum health benefit.",
    detail: "The right mix of nutrients is highly important for health. It can sustain and charge your body in several ways. However, there are various factors that can stop us from getting the necessary dose of wellness, especially in the morning. Due to the busy lifestyle we hardly get time to take care of our health. We often skip breakfast and meals during the day.  Often in a rush, we eat sugary cereals for breakfast to save time, settle for junk food and fast food for our lunch cravings. We miss out on a balanced diet which is essential to maintain health. Ignoring a good diet and nutrition takes away your energy and also compromises the body immunity.  Little changes in our diet can help us in the long run to stay healthy. Choosing whole grains over refined grains and incorporating more protein into the diet, can help us maintain good health. More vegetables and fruits in our daily diet can help in attaining good health and can also mitigate the risk of diseases.  Nutritionist Tripti Tandon in her Instagram post recently shared a few food combinations that can bring amazing health benefits.  GREEN TEA+ LEMONS  People often start their day with a cup of Green Tea with a few drops of lemon in it. Green tea mixed with lemon can provide a good amount of antioxidants. It helps in cognitive function and helps in fat burning. Green tea can positively affect our metabolism and helps reduce weight. According to various studies, it may help in reducing the risks of cancer and protect the brain from ageing.  WALNUTS AND BLUEBERRIES  Walnuts are heart-healthy fats and high in antioxidants. A regular dose of walnuts may enhance brain health and cut down the risk of cancer and heart diseases. While blueberries are high on antioxidants and provide health benefits related to heart, mental health and blood pressure. A blend of blueberries and walnuts can create a vitalising and delicious meal."

    description: "The best way to stay in great health during the monsoon is to adopt mindful eating practises, choose seasonal foods, and maintain an active lifestyle.",
    detail: "The monsoon season has arrived, bringing with it a welcome break from the oppressively hot summer. However, this season also contributes to a number of health issues. Infections caused by mosquitoes, such as dengue fever, malaria, the seasonal flu, and typhoid, are more common during the monsoon season. Divya Kaur, a nutritionist, stated that the monsoon season “brings with it several infections and ailments like cholera and malaria. These fruits will strengthen your immune system and assist you in battling these diseases. The dietitian provides a list of seasonal fruits that can help you keep healthy and fit.  Peaches: These fruits contain fluoride, which promotes better oral health. Either consume it raw, blend it with salad, or consume the pulp. Vitamins, potassium, folate, and iron are among the powerful components found in jamun. During the monsoon, all of these nutrients are particularly beneficial.  Litchi: It contains many antioxidants that improve asthmatic patients’ ability to breathe and hasten weight loss. Litchi strengthens the immune system and aids in disease resistance in the body. When a common cold is contracted during the monsoon, vitamin C from litchis can aid.  Plums: Plums are inexpensive fruits in a little packaging. These fruits’ reddish-blue anthocyanin pigment guards against cancer as well. Your body is therefore more susceptible to infection and water-borne illnesses during the monsoon, which can negatively impact your health. Thus, maintaining your fitness is crucial.  Cherries: They are a great source of antioxidants and they stop or reverse the harm that free radicals bring to your body’s cells. They are also recognised as effective cancer prevention tools. In addition, they reduce arthritis pain, which worsens in the wet season.  Jamuns: They are low in calories and rich in vitamins, iron, folate, potassium, and other minerals. It is best to eat this fruit during the monsoon season. Additionally, it aids in the treatment of illnesses and digestive issues that commonly surface during the rainy season."

    description: "From classic Margherita to exotic combinations, this circular delight has seen endless creativity from chefs worldwide",
    detail: "Pizza is a food that has originated in Italy and transcended borders to become a global food that is available across different countries with their own version. In India, we love a traditional pizza as much as a gourmet pizza. So, how has this dish that symbolises taste and comfort, evolved over the years? The round-shaped dish has taken different forms, but nothing comes to the satisfaction of pulling a slice of pizza topped with cheese and choice of vegetables or meat.  Speaking of its origins, Dhaval Udeshi, Co-founder of Chrome Hospitality, says, “Ever been curious to know about the origin of the modern day pizza – how it came to be and some of its original toppings? As random as it may look like, pizza has a vibrant history. Pizza as we know it today has been around for three or so centuries. As early as the 3rd century, our forefathers would blend bread with varieties of toppings. So, we could trace pizza roots back to ancient times.”  Pizzas have surely changed over the years, and we love to have anything with a dash of Indian flavours in it. “Pizzas in India have changed a lot over the years. It started as a simple flatbread with tomatoes and cheese. But now, it has become a popular comfort food enjoyed by people of all backgrounds. Indian flavours like paneer, chicken tikka, and spices have been added to pizzas, creating a fusion of tastes. Technology and globalization have made pizzas more accessible, and customization options allow people to create their own unique pizzas. At Balmy, we have found our niche and preference with our classic wafer thin-crust pizzas with modernized toppings and flavours. Our pizzas have definitely become a crowd-favourite,” adds Sujith Shetty, Owner of Balmy, Breach Candy.  With the change in taste for pizza evolving globally, things have certainly changed even for restaurateurs. “All over the world, there has been a shift in the way people interact with pizza. The older, traditional pizzerias that popularised the thick crust, cheese laden pizza have been replaced by new-age pizzerias who perfectly balance the need for indulgence with the shift in consumer tastes. People are interested in not only a delicious product and an excellent ambience but attribute equal importance to the provenance and process their food is made from and the effect it has on their lifestyle and health, shares Ayush Jatia, Founder of Nonna’s."

    description: "Our favourite garlic naan took an outstanding second place, while naan took fifth place overall",
    detail: "Indian flatbreads have acquired popularity on a global scale, as seen by the most current list published by online food directory Taste Atlas. On July 6, 2023, a list of the top flatbreads from around the world was revealed. A number of Indian flatbreads have achieved rankings inside the top 50, demonstrating both their popularity and culinary prowess.  'Flatbreads have been enjoyed across different cultures for centuries, with each region adding its own distinct flavours and techniques to this culinary creation. While determining the absolute best flatbread would be an impossible task for anyone, we’ve turned to mathematics and counted your votes - as we always do,' read the caption.  Only the top five entries contained two Indian entries prominently. While naan as a whole took fifth place, butter garlic naan impressively got second place. The winner was Roti Canai, a multi-layered, crispy bread from Malaysia that is thought to have Indian origins.  Other Indian breads farther down the list, like paratha, Amritsari kulcha, and plain roti, were praised for their great flavour and texture. Aaloo naan, Kashmiri naan, aloo paratha, and roomali roti were also mentioned among the top 50.  International breads like lavash, pita bread, focaccia, and tortilla also gained prominence in the rankings alongside Indian flatbreads. This exemplifies the great variety of flatbreads seen in many global cuisines."

    detail: "Perhaps the most painful part of ordering a pizza is the waiting. Unless you head to some grab-and-go spot with the constant, warming glow of a hot light, bringing your pizza from dough to done takes time. (Heck, even ordering a classic NYC slice usually requires a few minutes back in the oven before it's slid over to you on a paper plate.) Tack onto the delivery driver's ride from the restaurant to your house, and the old '30 minutes or less' pizza delivery promise feels like it's pushing the limit.  But DiGiorno doesn't do delivery. That's kind of their whole thing. The Nestlé-owned frozen pizza brand has made it their entire marketing campaign to point out that its product offers restaurant-style pizza from your freezer via your oven in less time than it takes to order one. That doesn't mean, however, that DiGiorno doesn't want you eating its pizza out and about. In fact, the latest technology the brand is testing could be setting up shop wherever you might be hungry for a hot pizza.  DiGiorno is currently trialing two 'pizza kiosk' locations at a Walmart in Colorado as well as at the Nestlé company's Ohio campus. The larger-than-usual vending machines house a commercial-grade oven as well as frozen, premade, 10-inch, thin-crust pizzas currently available in Cheese and Pepperoni options, a Nestlé spokesperson confirmed to Food & Wine. As for speed, DiGiorno's machine outputs a fully-cooked pizza in about three minutes. For now, the pies sell for about $9 each."

    detail: "It's no secret that instant coffee is better than ever (look no further than this instant iced latte hack). But when it comes to competing with your average coffee chain, Maxwell House is getting innovative. Its newest product brings the barista-made experience home with an instant latte that makes its own foam.  You read that right. In a first-to-market move, Maxwell House's new Iced Latte with Foam line of products will have you rethinking what you expect to come out of one of those little sachets of instant coffee. The steps to making these lattes are the pretty standard instant coffee process: Pour and stir. But once the ice water hits the powdered drink in the bottom of your glass, it adds the extra pizzaz of a layer of foam on top, no milk frother necessary.  “As iced beverages continue to rise in coffee shops, this opens a huge opportunity to continue the growth of cold in the coffee aisle at grocery stores,” Sweta Kannan, director of marketing and coffee innovation at Kraft Heinz, said. 'Our never-before-seen cold-stirred foam technology will allow coffee lovers to save the time and money of going to a coffee shop, and instead inspire them to unleash their inner barista by providing an easy-to-make café-style experience with every sip in three simple steps.'"

    detail: "We're not here to defend or decry the price of restaurant guacamole. After all, restaurants are affected by many costs that might be unknown to the average diner. But we will admit that all the slicing and dicing and mincing and mashing that goes into creating the perfect batch of guac is a lot of work — not to mention the potential hazards associated with cutting open an avocado.  Perhaps that's why Chipotle, infamous for reminding customers that its guac will cost extra, is looking to automate the process by testing a new guacamole-making robot, the Autocado.  Autocado is actually defined as a 'cobotic' prototype, which means it's a robot that is meant to function within an existing team of humans (rather than replace them, per se). Chipotle's announcement claims the Autocado is intended to address and alleviate workers from time-consuming tasks identified by its restaurant training managers. According to the brand, a typical batch of guacamole takes 50 minutes to prepare, even with workers dedicated to slicing and scooping avocados in each store.  So how does it work? First, a human loads up to 25 pounds of avocados into the machine, which are then oriented vertically, sliced in half, and automatically cored and peeled before being deposited into one of those familiar large, stainless steel bowls, where the final ingredients are mixed and mashed in (again, by human hands). Chipotle hopes future iterations of the Autocado could also inspect avocados for quality and further reduce waste."

And while Burger King's American restaurants have offered Impossible Whoppers for years, a new international product is also getting in on the act. Just not at all in the way you might expect.  This week, Burger King Thailand unveiled a meatless burger. No, not a veggie burger. A literal meatless burger known as the “real cheeseburger,” made with 20 slices of American cheese on a bun. And nothing else.  The menu item dropped on Sunday, July 8, along with a social media post ensuring people, “This is not a joke. This is for real.”  The “burger” is currently selling for 109 Thai baht, or about $3. The, again, “burger,” quickly went viral, with patrons flocking to the nearest Burger King to buy one and post about the experience on TikTok.  Are 20 pieces aren’t enough for you? According to the brand’s Facebook post, you can add two more slices for 20 Thai baht, or about .58 cents.  While a cheesy sandwich sounds delicious to some (i.e., me), others who’ve tested the, once again in quotes, “burger,” say it’s a little much."

However, you'll have to order some pizza to get it.  Starting July 17, Pepsi Pineapple will return exclusively at Little Caesars restaurants. The drink will be part of the Pineapple Pair-Up Combo, playing on the evergreen controversy surrounding whether pineapple belongs on pizza.  'There's always a passionate discussion surrounding pineapple on pizza,' Greg Hamilton, chief marketing officer at Little Caesars, said. 'Together with Pepsi, we're satisfying ALL pineapple lovers, regardless of how they feel about it as a pizza topping. The Pineapple Pair-Up Combo gives our customers an exclusive opportunity to enjoy the tropical taste on their Thin Crust pizza, in their Pepsi, or both.'"

    description: "A debt crisis is pushing millions more people around the world into hunger.",
    detail: "The International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES-Food) released a special report sounding the alarm on global food insecurity and debt crises. The report finds that 349 million people are facing acute starvation and many more will experience hunger with food prices remaining at historic highs and countries failing to meet debt repayments.  In “Breaking the Cycle of Unsustainable Food Systems, Hunger, and Debt,” IPES-Food reports that the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine contributed to rising food prices in the last two years.  “Although there has been some easing of food prices in recent months, it is unpredictable what the fallout from the interplay with the debt crisis will be,” Jennifer Clapp, Canada Research Chair in Global Food Security and Sustainability at the University of Waterloo, Ontario and co-author of the report, tells Food Tank. “But we are seeing food price inflation remaining higher than overall inflation, and this is deeply troubling.”  And now authors state that low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are threatened by a worsening debt crisis. IPES-Food finds 60 percent of low-income countries and 30 percent of middle-income countries are at high risk of defaulting on their debt. According to the report, Zambia, Sri Lanka, and Suriname defaulted already. Meanwhile, countries including Ghana and Pakistan are at risk of doing so.  The report highlights four critical ways that unsustainable food systems deepen the debt crisis for dozens of LMICs. These nations face import dependencies for food and fertilizers, which forces them to rely on cash crops to repay debts and prevents them from diversifying crops. Additionally, decades of divestment from social services and domestic agricultural production have further exacerbated the challenges. As food prices spike and crash, farmers find themselves unable to compete with large corporations. And the worsening climate crisis is increasing uncertainty, destroying harvests and deepening farmer debt."

In the northern areas of the country, paratha is also a popular dish that is available on the street-side stalls. Vendors often serve parathas with chole, dal or as it is. Recently, however, the video of the making of a paratha by a street vendor has left the internet in shock. The reason was the copious quantity of oil used in the video. The video was shared on Instagram by user Gurwinder Singh Maan, who runs a travel and food blog by the name of @gsfoodtravels. The clip of the paratha has raked in over 1.9 million views and 28.7k likes. 'Punjab ka healthy paratha,' he wrote in the caption of the post. In the clip, we could see a half-cooked paratha on an iron griddle or tawa. As the paratha started to brown, the street vendor poured oil onto it from a huge tin canister. The amount of oil used was quite excessive and unnecessary. Then, he flipped over the paratha and cooked it from the other side, draining the excessive oil.  A flurry of reactions poured into the paratha video shared by the Instagram blogger. Many said that this generous use of oil could prove harmful to heart health. '30 ka paratha 30 lakh ka transplant,' wrote one user. 'First bite will taste like heaven. The second one will take you there,' commented another user. 'Bro using food oil like engine oil!'"

'The perfect product-market fit,'' he wrote in the caption. The post has received over 435k views and hundreds of comments and likes. In the click, we could see how the shape of the usual French fries had been transformed and made into a little spoon. Thus, one end of the French fries could be used to scoop out extra ketchup, mayonnaise or any other dip of choice. Thus, you would not need to take extra fries or dip them a second time.  The unique concept was actually a part of a contest launched by the popular ketchup brand Heinz in July 2022. On the occasion of French Fry Day, they announced that they were giving away a couple of bags to UK residents. However, the spoon-shaped fries have been going viral once again on Twitter.  A number of internet users reacted to the spoon-shaped fries that surfaced online. 'The perfect product doesn't ex...,' said one user while another wrote, 'Nah this is...this is pretty smart!' Some pointed out that billionaire and Twitter owner Elon Musk too had liked the unique concept of spoon-shaped fries.  Heinz CEO: 'We need a way to boost ketchup consumption and horizontally integrate into the utensil market.'

What's better than a crispy crust that cracks on a bite and then gives way to flavourful juicy flesh? Crispy fried chicken is popular across the world, and every region has its own way of preparing this indulgence. TasteAtlas, a popular food guide, recently released its list of the “10 Best Fried Chicken Dishes” in the world. Guess who bagged the top spot in this prestigious list? It is Indonesia with its decadent ayam goreng, which has scored 4.6 stars out of 5. Indonesia surely has some amazing fried chicken dishes as the country also occupied the sixth position on the list.

Talking about its preparation, they wrote, “In its basic form, Indonesian-style fried chicken consists of chicken cuts, preferably bone-in pieces such as thighs and drumsticks, which are marinated in spices, then shortly braised before being fried until golden and crispy.” Indonesian-style fried chicken can be relished individually as a snack or can be paired up with rice, fresh vegetables and salads.Which is your favourite fried chicken dish?

    detail: "Renowned filmmaker R Balki, known for his exceptional work in movies like Cheeni Kum, Paa, and Pad Man, is making a comeback with his upcoming release, Ghoomer. This inspirational sports drama stars Abhishek Bachchan and Saiyami Kher in the lead roles, and the film's trailer was released to much anticipation. R Balki has managed to generate excitement among fans by comparing the climax of Ghoomer to that of the blockbuster Gadar: Ek Prem Katha. Interestingly, the sequel of Gadar is set to hit the screens just a few days before Ghoomer, on August 11, featuring Sunny Deol, Ameesha Patel, and Utkarsh Sharma reprising their roles.  During a media Q&A session which was held as part of the trailer release today, Abhishek Bachchan was asked whether Ghoomer would be a game changer for him. In response, he humbly acknowledged that every film holds the potential to make or break the future of everyone involved, be it the actors, directors, or producers.  He said, 'For every director, actor and producer, and the others who work for a film, it is the Friday that decides their future. Every film is a make-or-break film and this is for every artist associated with the film. It is the Friday that decided if the audiences are going to love you, hate you or want to see more of you. Ghoomer is no different as it's the same.'  He added, “But, coming into a dark theatre to watch a good film with samosa and popcorn in your hand, nothing beats that experience”.  Abhishek expressed joy in the fact that the film will be released in theatres on August 18, as it offers a unique and immersive experience for the audience, something that cannot be replicated on OTT platforms.  In conclusion, Abhishek expressed his gratitude for the film's big-screen release and the opportunity to give the audience a memorable cinema experience with Ghoomer."

    detail: "Krrish 4 starring Hrithik Roshan is a superhero movie that fans have been waiting for, for a decade now. What started with Koi Mil Gaya and Krrish, Krrish 3, it's now high time for another film in the franchise. Hrithik Roshan has given ample hints about the movie as it is and there have been several updates as well. Be it in terms of speculations or the reactions from Hrithik and his father, filmmaker Rakesh Roshan. Recently, Rakesh shared an update about Krrish 4 and it's heartbreaking.  Krrish 4 delayed? Rakesh Roshan spills the beans  While talking to an entertainment news portal, Rakesh Roshan expressed his concern about making Krrish 4 in today's time. Well, the business is picking up in the industry but not much. The audience is watching movies but in relatively lower numbers than before. Rakesh shares that the audience is still not going to theatres and the world is becoming smaller these days. The kids are watching superhero movies made by Hollywood. The budget of Hollywood films are sky high. They are made on a budget of Rs 500 to 600 million dollars. And in comparison to their budget, Hrithik Roshan starrer Krrish 4 is being made on a budget of Rs 200 to 300 crores.  Rakesh Roshan on making Krrish 4 and giving quality content  The films of Hollywood have a standard and there's a huge fan base in India for such movies. But in the said budget, how to give an Indian superhero movie the same look and feel? He can cut down on the action sequences but then the quality should be at par. Also, the VFX needs to be really good. The investment in VFX needs quite a huge sum. The filmmaker shares that they are finding ways to maintain the budget and the production cost. However, even the big films are not performing so well at the box office."

    description: "Actor Alia Bhatt has now finally made her transition from Bollywood to Hollywood with her new spy-thriller-action film 'Heart of Stone'.",
    detail: "Actor Alia Bhatt has now finally made her transition from Bollywood to Hollywood with her new spy-thriller-action film ‘Heart of Stone’, where she stars alongside popular Israeli actress Gal Gadot.  Speaking about her transition, Alia Bhatt said that suddenly doing a movie in full English language was a bit weird for her, but overall it was a great experience for her.  In an interview with the Toronto Sun, Alia was asked about her transition where she said: “You know it was a bit awkward for me speaking in English all time, because I’m so used to speaking in Hindi even though I use English half the time, suddenly acting in English was a bit weird.”  “But apart from that, day one… kind of awkwardness, I really really felt that it was the same. The process of a film set world over is exactly the same,” she added.  Talking about filming the action, Gal Gadot, who plays the role of Rachel Stone, said: “It took months of prep time, different workouts and training. But we all knew what was gonna be the case. You know it is such an intense action packed film that we knew we were going to have to be as prepped as possible (sic).”  Gal Gadot, who serves as producer, said that she really wanted to make this film.  “After the success of ‘Wonder Woman’, I realised that there was a lot more space for female led movies in the action genre and we just went for it. We realised that there was an audience for these types of movies, and as long as you create a story which has all the elements with a good balance, then it has the potential to be a success,” she said.  Talking about entering the spy-genre given its popularity, Gadot said: “I think, first of all, I’m a big fan of this genre, ‘Bond’, ‘Mission Impossible‘, ‘Bourne Identity’, ‘Die Hard’, all these films. I love them.”  “I love the suspense, the twists and turns, the drama, the scope, everything about them. I love getting into a movie and going through a journey, and feeling like I’ve been all around the world and come back, closer than being delivered or in the theater,” she added.  When asked what goes into playing a good villain, Alia, who plays the antagonist in the film Keya Dhawan, said: “Belief..in your purpose. Because I think there are two sides to a story right and sometimes you are on the right side, sometimes you are on the wrong side or sometimes you are just on opposite sides. So as long as you deeply believe that your side is truly the right one, you know the other side is the villain, you are not the villain.”  The topic of artificial intelligence is something that everyone these days are talking about and much of the spy-genre films these days ranging from ‘Spectre’ to ‘Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning’ all deal with it.  As AI plays a key role in the movie, both the actresses were asked about their thoughts on AI, to which Alia said: “I think anything in excess is not really great, and I definitely feel that there are a lot of benefits of technology.”"

    description: "Corrin joins franchise newcomer Matthew Macfadyen, as well as Marvel veterans Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Jennifer Garner's Elektra.",
    detail: "In an interview with Empire Magazine conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike, Corrin shared they were “really excited to play a villain” — however, which villain still remains a secret.  “I haven’t done that, and it’s an itch I want to scratch,” Corrin, who goes by they/them pronouns, said. Director Shawn Levy approached the actor after seeing them onstage in a production of Virginia Woolf’s Orlando. “I’d heard about the project but, classic Marvel, they couldn’t tell me anything about it,” they continued. “Absolutely nothing. Zilch. So, I met him being like, ‘I don’t know what this is about.'”  The actor, who broke out on The Crown, explained that stepping into the Marvel universe was new for them in more ways than one since they weren’t very familiar with the heroes.  “I’ve watched Spider-Man and Black Panther. I was like, ‘Look, you’re gonna have to debrief me into this,'” they continued. “It’s such an intricate world. There’s so much to it. It’s an absolute mind-fuck. All the language and the Easter eggs, and this person is related to that person who did this, and this person came back and this person’s dead… it’s amazing.”  Corrin has stepped up to the plate, however, studying the character, as well as other Marvel stalwarts.  “I really understand why it means as much as it does to so many people,” they said. “It’s a phenomenon, and I feel really lucky to be part of it, especially Deadpool because I love the fact that it’s self-aware, and critical of its own inner workings.”  Deadpool 3 sees the return of Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine, who will be donning his famous yellow suit once again. The film had begun production in London before the actors strike but has since been put on hold. Ryan Reynolds stars as the foul-mouthed antihero, Jennifer Garner plays Elektra after a nearly 20-year hiatus and Succession star Matthew Macfadyen joins the film in an unknown role.  Corrin’s interview was conducted in support of the limited series A Murder at the End of the World, which was originally set to premiere at the end of August on FX before being pushed to November amid the ongoing actors and writers strikes."
